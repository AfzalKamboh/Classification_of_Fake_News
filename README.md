Problem Statement

In our daily lives, we encounter news through various channels. However, distinguishing between authentic and fabricated news can be challenging. The objective is to develop a predictive model that determines the authenticity of a given news article.




Project Topics:
  * Data Collection
  * Data Preparation: This involves several steps such as tokenization, converting to lowercase, removing stopwords, and lemmatization/stemming.
  * Vectorization: Converting text data into numerical vectors using techniques like Bag of Words (CountVectorizer) and TF-IDF.
  * Model Creation: Initializing a model object and training/testing the model.
  * Model Evaluation: Assessing the model using metrics like accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.
  * Model Deployment
  * Predicting on Client Data


Technology Stack Used:
  * Python
  * Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  * Machine Learning Algorithms
